# RFD 0183 - Optionally Require Reason for Access Requests

## What

Add an option to require the 'Reason' field in Access Requests for specific Resources or Roles.

## Why

The 'Reason' field in Access Requests is currently optional and can be left empty.
This can lead to confusion and unnecessary back-and-forth between the requester and
approver, especially when the request is for a sensitive Resource or Role, or exists
in an environment with compliance requirements that mandate a reason for access.
