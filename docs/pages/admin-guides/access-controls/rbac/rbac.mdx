## Getting Started with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Teleport

This guide will help you understand and implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Teleport, and help you set up a working RBAC environment quickly. We will explain what RBAC is, how roles function, and how they control access in Teleport. If you're new to RBAC or want to understand how Teleport's role system works, this section provides foundational knowledge.

We will walk you through setting up RBAC in real-world use cases, assigning roles to users, and using Teleportâ€™s resource tagging and matching logic. 

By tailoring permissions based on specific attributes and conditions, you can enable targeted control over individual databases, servers, Kubernetes namespaces, and other resources across development, staging, and production environments.
