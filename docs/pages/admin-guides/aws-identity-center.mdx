With Teleport Identity Center integration, you can:

- Provision user and groups from Teleport into AWS Identity Center.
- Provision permission assignment from Teleport into AWS Identity Center that grants access to AWS accounts.
- Authenticate Teleport users to AWS Identity Center via Teleport a SAML IdP.

</Notice>

## Prerequisites

- Teleport version:
  - Cloud staging tenant `awsic-dev.cloud.gravitational.io` is patched with version `17.0.0-dev.awsic.5`
  that features the identity center serivce. To test it in your own cluster, pull the branch `sshah/idc-dev` 
  from `telepeort` and `telepeort.e` repository and deploy to staging tenant. Cloud hosting is required as 
  the integration depends on AWS OIDC integration to authenticate itslef to AWS API.
- Administrative access in Telepert with the following permissions.
  - `read`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `delete` access to `saml_idp_service_provider` resource.
  - `read`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `delete` access to `access_list` resource.
  - `read`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `delete` access to `integration` resource.
  - (new) `read`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `delete` access to `aws_iam_ic_account` resource.
  - (new) `account_assignment_labels` on the `role.spec.allow.`. Note: Although this label is required
    for now, we are in a discussion to remove it. Please refer back to this doc if it stops working for you.
- Administrative permission in AWS.
  - Identity Center enabled for organization. Teleport does not support account-level identity center.
  - AWS API permissions.
    - Permission to enable and manage Identity Center.
    - Permission to create AWS OIDC identity provider.
    - Permission to create and update AWS IAM role.


## Step 1/2. Install Identity Center plugin
**Note:** You need AWS Identiy Center enabled for your organization at this point.

### 1.1 Configure AWS integration

Click on the Identity Center tile available in the Enroll New integration page.

In the first step, you need to provide
- Identity Center region. Copy this data from Identity Center.
- Identity Center ARN. Copy this data from Identity Center.
- A new integration name that will be used to create AWS OIDC integration.

The Web UI will then let you generate integration script.

Note: Pasting this command directly in the AWS console fails for now as the generated script expects teleport binary to be 
available in the `cdn.teleport.dev` (which is used in production) but the dev
releases are only available in `cdn.cloud.gravitational.io`.

As a work around, you can do the following:
1. copy the script URL and download it in the aws cloud shell `curl 'https://copied_script_url' -o awsoidc.sh`
2. replace the CDN URL `sed -i 's~https://cdn.teleport.dev~https://cdn.cloud.gravitational.io~g' awsoidc.sh ` (or manually replace  `cdn.teleport.dev` with `cdn.cloud.gravitational.io`
3. `chmod +x awsoidc.sh`
4. `./awsoidc.sh`


<Notice type="info">
To accommodate permissions required for the Identity Center integration, the
`teleport integration configure awsoidc-idp` has been updated with `--policy-preset=aws-identity-center` flag that
configures required permissions for Identity Center integration:
```bash
$ teleport integration configure awsoidc-idp --cluster=example.cloud.gravitational.io --proxy-public-url=https://example.cloud.gravitational.io --name=teleport-aws-ic --role=teleport-aws-ic --policy-preset=aws-identity-center 
```

The command is available in the dev release `v17.0.0-dev.awsic.5`: https://cdn.cloud.gravitational.io/teleport-ent-v17.0.0-dev.awsic.5-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
</Notice>

Once a new AWS IAM role is created and updated with permissions, you will need to copy the ARN 
of that role paste it to the Web UI.


### 1.2 Preview resources and select default Access List owner

In this step, Web UI lets you preview the resources that will be imported from AWS Identity Center to
Teleport. If you have just enabled Identity Center for your organization, you may not have
any resource available yet. That is okay for now as Teleport will start provisioning resource form Teleport
to AWS once the integration is complete.

Pick users to be configured as default owners for Access List. Existing groups in AWS Identity Center
will be imported as Access List in Teleport (the group import is WIP but configure default owners right away
so it can be picked up once the import is supported).


### 1.3 Configure Identity Center identity source

In this step, you wil:
- Configure Teleport SAML IdP as an identity source for Identity Center.
  - You will need to upload Teleport SAML IdP metadata to Identity Center.
- Add Identity Center as a SAML service provdier to Teleport.
  - You will need to upload Identity Center SAML metada file to Teleport.
  - Teleport uses a default `aws-identity-center` name for the SAML service provider.
    **Note**: The name is hardcoded and will not work if you already have a SAML provider with the same name.
    Naming conflict resolution will be resolved in a subsequent plugin update.


### 1.4 Configure SCIM

Once you configure identiy source, AWS lets you enable automatic user provisioning
with SCIM. Follow Web UI to enable and retrieve the SCIM credential and paste it in
the input fields.

Test the credential with `Test` button. Once Telpoert validates response is valid,
Click on Finish button to complete plugin installation.
In this step, you wil:


After you install the plugin, the identity center service will
- Import Identity Center accounts. They will be available in Teleport Web UI as an AWS application.
- Import permission assignment. They will be availble in Teleport as roles, which can be used to
  request or grant access to the AWS accounts.
- Import groups as Access List. 
  - Groups without permission assignments are likely to fail at this time
since Access List creation requires one role/trait grant by default. We will filter such groups in the 
next iteration. 
  - Groups members available in the AWS are not currently reflected in Teleport Access List. 


## Step 2/2. Test Access Request and permission provisioning.

Upon successful role grant via Access Request ceremony, Teleport provisions
granted permission assignment into AWS Identity Center.


An Access Request for Identity Center resource typically involves four kinds of role.
1. Role that grants access to Identity Center resource in Teleport.
2. Role that defines AWS Identity Center permission assignment.
3. Role for user to request access to the role #1 and #2
4. Role for administrator to grant access to roles #1 and #2 and #3.


### 1. Role that grants access to Identity Center resource in Teleport.
```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: ic_all_access
spec:
  allow:
    account_assignment_labels:
      '*': '*'
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
    rules:
    - resources:
      - aws_iam_ic_account
      verbs:
      - list
      - create
      - read
      - update
      - delete
    - resources:
      - saml_idp_service_provider
      verbs:
      - list
      - create
      - read
      - update
      - delete
...

```

### 2. Role that defines AWS Identity Center permission assignment.

When you install the Identity Center plugin, Teleport import the permission sets from the
Identity Center and create them as the role as reference below.
```yaml
kind: role
sub_kind: aws_iam_identity_center
version: v7
metadata:
  labels:
    teleport.dev/origin: aws_iam_ic
  name: AdministratorAccess-on-dev-account
spec:
  allow:
    account_assignment_labels:
      teleport.dev/account-id: "<account_id>"
    account_assignments:
    - account: "<account_id>" # id of AWS identity center account.
      name: AdministratorAccess # name of the permission set in AWS
      permission_set: arn:aws:sso:::permissionSet/ssoins-8824eede0d4dd26a/ps-25beafadd65e32d5
...

```

### 3. Role for user to request access to the role #1 and #2
```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: request_aws_iam_ic
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      roles:
      - ic_all_access
      - AdministratorAccess-on-goteleport-local
      search_as_roles:
      - ic_all_access
      - AdministratorAccess-on-goteleport-local
    rules:
    - resources:
      - aws_iam_ic_account
      verbs:
      - list
      - create
      - read
      - update
      - delete
  deny:
  ...
  options:
 ...
version: v7
```

### 4. Role for administrator to grant access to roles #1 and #2 and #3.
```
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: reviewer
spec:
  allow:
    review_requests:
      preview_as_roles:
      - ic_all_access
      - AdministratorAccess-on-dev-account
      roles:
      - ic_all_access
      - AdministratorAccess-on-dev-account
...

```

Upon Access Request approval, Teleport provisions permission assignment in Identity Center.
Usually, the assignment is provisioned immidiately but sometime may take up to a minute or more.


## Step 2/2. Test Access List and permission provisioning.

Adding members to an Access List associated with Identity Center should reflect that member
in the AWS Identity Center group. 

Adding a role that contains Identity Center permission to an Access List should update the permission 
assignment for the associated group in the Identity Center.
