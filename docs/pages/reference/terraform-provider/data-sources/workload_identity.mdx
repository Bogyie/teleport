## Schema

### Optional

- `metadata` (Attributes) Common metadata that all resources share. (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) The configured properties of the WorkloadIdentity (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-spec))
- `sub_kind` (String) Differentiates variations of the same kind. All resources should contain one, even if it is never populated.
- `version` (String) The version of the resource being represented.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Optional:

- `description` (String) description is object description.
- `expires` (String) expires is a global expiry time header can be set on any resource in the system.
- `labels` (Map of String) labels is a set of labels.
- `name` (String) name is an object name.


### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `rules` (Attributes) Rules holds the authorization rules that must pass for this WorkloadIdentity to be used. See [WorkloadIdentityRules] for further documentation. (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-specrules))
- `spiffe` (Attributes) SPIFFE holds configuration for the structure of SPIFFE-compatible workload identity credentials for this WorkloadIdentity. See [WorkloadIdentitySPIFFE] for further documentation. (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-specspiffe))

### Nested Schema for `spec.rules`

Optional:

- `allow` (Attributes List) Allow is a list of rules, each containing a set of attribute matchers. For a rule to match, all matchers within the rule must match. If rules are specified, then at least one rule must match for issuance to be permitted. If no rules are specified, issuance is permitted. (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-specrulesallow))
- `deny` (Attributes List) Deny is a set of rules, each containing a set of attribute matchers. For a rule to match, all matchers within the rule must match. If rules are specified, then all rules must not match for issuance to be permitted. If no rules are specified, issuance is permitted. (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-specrulesdeny))

### Nested Schema for `spec.rules.allow`

Optional:

- `conditions` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-specrulesallowconditions))

### Nested Schema for `spec.rules.allow.conditions`

Optional:

- `attribute` (String)
- `equals` (String)



### Nested Schema for `spec.rules.deny`

Optional:

- `conditions` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-specrulesdenyconditions))

### Nested Schema for `spec.rules.deny.conditions`

Optional:

- `attribute` (String)
- `equals` (String)




### Nested Schema for `spec.spiffe`

Optional:

- `id` (String) Id is the path of the SPIFFE ID that will be issued in workload identity credentials when this WorkloadIdentity is used. It can be templated using attributes.  Examples: - `/no/templating/used` -> `spiffe://example.teleport.sh/no/templating/used` - `/gitlab/{{ join.gitlab.project_path }}` -> `spiffe://example.teleport.sh/gitlab/org/project`
