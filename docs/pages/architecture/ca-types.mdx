This page provides a summary of what each CA type is used for in Teleport.

## Viewing certificate authorities inside Teleport

You can view the status of each CA inside Teleport with `tctl status`:

```code
root@ip-172-31-30-140:~# tctl status
Cluster       teleport.example.com
Version       16.0.3
host CA       rotated Dec  3 2023 19:43:59 UTC
user CA       rotated Dec  3 2023 19:43:59 UTC
db CA         never updated
db_client CA  never updated
openssh CA    never updated
jwt CA        rotated Dec  3 2023 19:43:59 UTC
saml_idp CA   never updated
oidc_idp CA   never updated
spiffe CA     never updated
CA pin        sha256:015c54b353210befba6e36480f0db89541b7a94d088c0cea21ffc2ea27848799
```

You can also get more detailed information about each CA using `tctl get cert_authority`:

```yaml
root@ip-172-31-30-140:~# tctl get cert_authority
kind: cert_authority

```

The `spec.type` field gives information about the type of CA, and the public keys are shown in the
`spec.active_keys` output.

During a CA rotation, there will be more than one key listed under each `spec.active_keys` section.

## Certificate authority types

### `host`

Issues certificates to Teleport agents and OpenSSH hosts which join the cluster and are registered
with the Teleport backend.

Documentation references:
- [tctl auth sign](../reference/cli/tctl.mdx#tctl-auth-sign)

### `user`

Issues short-lived certificates to users and/or bots who perform operations in the cluster (for example:
`tsh login`, `tbot`, web UI logins)

Documentation references:
- [tsh login](../reference/cli/tsh.mdx#tsh-login)

### `db`

Issues certificates which can be installed on databases that teleport needs to trust on connection
(i.e. the PostgreSQL server running on a host presents a cert from the `db` CA to a connecting Teleport
`db_service` agent)

Documentation references:
- [Database CA rotations](../management/operations/db-ca-migrations.mdx)

### `db_client`

Issues short-lived certificates for connecting database clients should trust (for exmaple `psql` run by a
user connecting to Teleport's database proxy sees a cert issued by the `db_client` CA)

Documentation references:
- [Database CA rotations](../management/operations/db-ca-migrations.mdx)

### `openssh`

The public key of this CA is installed onto OpenSSH hosts as `TrustedUserCAKeys` to trust users connecting
from Teleport, then short-lived certs are issued from this CA whenever a user makes a connection through
the Teleport proxy to a joined OpenSSH host.

Documentation references:
- [Using Teleport with OpenSSH in agentless mode](../server-access/openssh/openssh.mdx)
- [Using Teleport with OpenSSH in agentless mode (manual installation)](../server-access/openssh/openssh-manual-install.mdx)

### `jwt`

Used to sign and issue certs for JWTs which are automatically sent in headers with requests from
Teleport's app_service to downstream applications, this CA provides the JWT public key available
at https://proxy-address/.well-known/jwks.json

Documentation references:
- [Use JWT Tokens With Application Access](../application-access/jwt/introduction.mdx)

### `saml_idp`

Used to sign requests when using Teleport as a SAML identity provider. This public key would be installed
on the SAML application (SP/service provider) side in order to trust Teleport as an identity provider.

Documentation references:
- [Teleport as a SAML identity provider](../access-controls/idps/saml-guide.mdx)

### `oidc_idp`

Used to sign requests when using Teleport as an OIDC identity provider. This public key would be installed
on the OIDC application side in order to trust Teleport as an identity provider.

Documentation references:
- [AWS OIDC Integration](../management/guides/awsoidc-integration.mdx)

### `spiffe`

Used to sign certificates issued with `tsh svid` and other SPIFFE-based operations inside the cluster.

Documentation references:
- [Workload Identity](../machine-id/workload-identity.mdx)
