title: Deploy Teleport Agents with Terraform
description: Learn how to use Terraform to deploy Teleport Agents and protect resources in your infrastructure.
---

An Agent is a Teleport instance configured to run one or more Teleport services
in order to proxy infrastructure resources. For a brief architectural overview
of how Agents run in a Teleport cluster, read the [Introduction to Teleport
Agents](introduction.mdx).

This guide shows you how to deploy a pool of Teleport Agents running on virtual
machines by declaring it as code using Terraform.

There are several methods you can use to join a Teleport Agent to your cluster,
which we discuss in the [Joining Services to your
Cluster](join-services-to-your-cluster.mdx) guide. In this guide, we will use
the **join token** method, where the operator stores a secure token on the Auth
Service, and an Agent presents the token in order to join a cluster.

No matter which join method you use, it will involve the following Terraform
resources:

- Compute instances to run Teleport services
- A join token for each compute instance in the agent pool

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

<Admonition type="tip">

We recommend following this guide on a fresh Teleport demo cluster so you can
see how an agent pool works. After you are familiar with the setup, apply the
lessons from this guide to protect your infrastructure. You can get started with
a demo cluster using:
- A demo deployment on a [Linux server](../index.mdx)
- A [Teleport Enterprise Cloud trial](https://goteleport.com/signup)

</Admonition>

- An AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure account with permissions to create virtual
  machine instances.
  
- Cloud infrastructure that enables virtual machine instances to connect to the
  Teleport Proxy Service. For example:
  - An AWS subnet with a public NAT gateway or NAT instance.
  - Google Cloud NAT
  - Azure NAT Gateway

  In minimum-security demo clusters, you can also configure the VM instances you
  deploy to have public IP addresses.

- Terraform v(=terraform.version=) or higher.

- An identity file for the Teleport Terraform provider. Make sure you are
  familiar with [how to set up the Teleport Terraform
  provider](../management/dynamic-resources/terraform-provider.mdx) before
  following this guide.

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/6. Set up a module for deploying Agents

1. Navigate to the directory for the root Terraform module that manages Teleport
   resources.
1. Create a directory in the root directory called `agents`.
1. In `agents`, create a file called `main.tf` with the following content:

   {/*TODO: Edit the main.tf file so it doesn't just show Azure*/}

   ```hcl
   (!examples/agent-pool-terraform/main.tf!)
   ```

## Step 2/6. Create Teleport tokens

  ```hcl
  (!examples/agent-pool-terraform/teleport/outputs.tf!)
  ```

  ```hcl 
  (!examples/agent-pool-terraform/teleport/required_providers.tf!)
  ```

  ```hcl 
  (!examples/agent-pool-terraform/teleport/inputs.tf!)
  ```

### Join token

The module deploys one virtual machine instance for each Teleport agent. Each
agent joins the cluster using a token. We create each token using the
`teleport_provision_token` Terraform resource, specifying the token's value with
a `random_string` resource:

```hcl
(!examples/agent-pool-terraform/teleport/token.tf!)
```

When we apply the `teleport_provision_token` resources, the Teleport Terraform
provider creates them on the Teleport Auth Service backend. 

## Step 3/6. Create resources for your cloud provider

1. In your root Terraform module, create a directory called `cloud` for
   resources to deploy to your cloud provider.

1. Follow the remaining instructions in this section based on your cloud
   provider. In the `cloud` directory, create a file called
   `required_providers.tf` with the following content:

  <Tabs>
  <TabItem label="AWS">

  ```hcl 
  (!examples/agent-pool-terraform/aws/required_providers.tf!)
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Google Cloud">

  ```hcl 
  (!examples/agent-pool-terraform/gcp/required_providers.tf!)
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Azure">

  Declare an Azure virtual machine resource to run Teleport agents using the
  `teleport_provision_token` resource, plus the required network interface for
  each instance. 
  
  Note that while Azure VM instances require a user account, this module
  declares a temporary one to pass validation, but uses Teleport to enable
  access to the instances:

  ```hcl 
  (!examples/agent-pool-terraform//azure/required_providers.tf!)
  ```

  </TabItem>
  </Tabs>


  <Tabs>
  <TabItem label="AWS">

  Declare a data source for an Amazon Linux 2023 machine image and uses it to
  launch EC2 instances that run Teleport agents with the
  `teleport_provision_token` resource:

  ```hcl 
  (!examples/agent-pool-terraform/aws/ec2-instance.tf!)
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Google Cloud">

  Declare Google Compute Engine instances that use the
  `teleport_provision_token` to run Teleport agents:

  ```hcl 
  (!examples/agent-pool-terraform/gcp/gcp-instance.tf!)
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Azure">

  ```hcl 
  (!examples/agent-pool-terraform/azure/azure-instance.tf!)
  ```

  </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

The configuration you created runs the following user data script on each agent
instance. The services enabled by the configuration file depend on the value of
the `agent_roles` input variable:

```hcl
(!examples/agent-pool-terraform/teleport/userdata!)
```
  <Tabs>
  <TabItem label="AWS">

  ```hcl 
  (!examples/agent-pool-terraform/aws/inputs.tf!)
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Google Cloud">

  ```hcl 
  (!examples/agent-pool-terraform/gcp/inputs.tf!)
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Azure">

  ```hcl 
  (!examples/agent-pool-terraform/azure/inputs.tf!)
  ```
  </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

## Step 4/6. Define dynamic resources

You can declare Terraform resources that enroll your infrastructure with
Teleport. The Teleport Terraform provider currently supports the following:

|Infrastructure Resource|Terraform Resource|
|---|---|
|Application|`teleport_app`|
|Database|`teleport_database`|

To declare a dynamic resource with Terraform, add a configuration block similar
to the ones below to a `*.tf` file in your `agent-pool-terraform` project
directory. 

The Teleport Terraform provider creates these on the Auth Service backend, and
the relevant Teleport services query them in order to proxy user traffic. For a
full list of supported resources and fields, see the [Terraform provider
reference](../reference/terraform-provider.mdx).

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Application">

```hcl
resource "teleport_app" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name        = "example"
    description = "Test app"
    labels = {
      // Teleport adds this label by default, so add it here to
      // ensure a consistent state.
      "teleport.dev/origin" = "dynamic"
    }
  }

  spec = {
    uri = "localhost:3000"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Database">

```hcl
resource "teleport_database" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name        = "example"
    description = "Test database"
    labels = {
      // Teleport adds this label by default, so add it here to
      // ensure a consistent state.
      "teleport.dev/origin" = "dynamic"
    }
  }

  spec = {
    protocol = "postgres"
    uri      = "localhost"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 5/6. Define static resources

Each Teleport service reads its local configuration file (`/etc/teleport.yaml`
by default) to determine which infrastructure resources to proxy. You can edit
this configuration file to enroll resources with Teleport.

In the setup we explored in this guide, you can edit the user data script for
each instance to add configuration settings to, for example, the
`database_service` or `kubernetes_service` sections.

To see how to configure each service, read its section of the documentation:

- [SSH Service](../server-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Database Service](../database-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Kubernetes Service](../kubernetes-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Windows Desktop Service](../desktop-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Application Service](../application-access/introduction.mdx)



## Step 6/6. Verify the deployment

Make sure your cloud provider credentials are available to Terraform using the
standard approach for your organization.

Apply the Terraform configuration:

```code
$ terraform init
$ terraform apply
```

Once the `apply` command completes, run the following command to verify that
your agents have deployed successfully. This command, which assumes that the
agents have the `Node` role, lists all Teleport SSH Service instances with the
`role=agent-pool` label:

```code
$ tsh ls role=agent-pool
Node Name                  Address    Labels
-------------------------- ---------- ---------------
ip-10-1-1-187.ec2.internal ⟵ Tunnel   role=agent-pool
ip-10-1-1-24.ec2.internal  ⟵ Tunnel   role=agent-pool
```
